### Data Preprocessing

This script handles the loading and preprocessing of training and testing data for a machine learning model. The key steps include:

1. **Loading Data**:
    - Reads training and testing data from CSV files ([`train_data.csv`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22train_data4.csv%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fmuskanp%2FDesktop%2FCSCI561-hw%2Fhw3%2Fhomework.py%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fmuskanp%2FDesktop%2FCSCI561-hw%2Fhw3%2Fhomework.py%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fmuskanp%2FDesktop%2FCSCI561-hw%2Fhw3%2Fhomework.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A7%2C%22character%22%3A35%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition"), [`train_label.csv`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22train_label4.csv%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fmuskanp%2FDesktop%2FCSCI561-hw%2Fhw3%2Fhomework.py%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fmuskanp%2FDesktop%2FCSCI561-hw%2Fhw3%2Fhomework.py%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fmuskanp%2FDesktop%2FCSCI561-hw%2Fhw3%2Fhomework.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A8%2C%22character%22%3A36%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition"), [`test_data.csv`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22test_data4.csv%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fmuskanp%2FDesktop%2FCSCI561-hw%2Fhw3%2Fhomework.py%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fmuskanp%2FDesktop%2FCSCI561-hw%2Fhw3%2Fhomework.py%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fmuskanp%2FDesktop%2FCSCI561-hw%2Fhw3%2Fhomework.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A9%2C%22character%22%3A34%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition"), [`test_label.csv`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22test_label4.csv%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fmuskanp%2FDesktop%2FCSCI561-hw%2Fhw3%2Fhomework.py%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fmuskanp%2FDesktop%2FCSCI561-hw%2Fhw3%2Fhomework.py%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fmuskanp%2FDesktop%2FCSCI561-hw%2Fhw3%2Fhomework.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A10%2C%22character%22%3A35%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition")).

2. **Dropping Irrelevant Columns**:
    - Removes columns that are not needed for the analysis, such as address-related fields.

3. **Encoding Categorical Variables**:
    - Converts categorical variables ([`BROKERTITLE`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22BROKERTITLE%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fmuskanp%2FDesktop%2FCSCI561-hw%2Fhw3%2Fhomework.py%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fmuskanp%2FDesktop%2FCSCI561-hw%2Fhw3%2Fhomework.py%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fmuskanp%2FDesktop%2FCSCI561-hw%2Fhw3%2Fhomework.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A20%2C%22character%22%3A20%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition"), [`LOCALITY`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22LOCALITY%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fmuskanp%2FDesktop%2FCSCI561-hw%2Fhw3%2Fhomework.py%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fmuskanp%2FDesktop%2FCSCI561-hw%2Fhw3%2Fhomework.py%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fmuskanp%2FDesktop%2FCSCI561-hw%2Fhw3%2Fhomework.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A20%2C%22character%22%3A35%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition")) into numerical format using factorization.

4. **One-Hot Encoding**:
    - Applies one-hot encoding to the [`TYPE`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22TYPE%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fmuskanp%2FDesktop%2FCSCI561-hw%2Fhw3%2Fhomework.py%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fmuskanp%2FDesktop%2FCSCI561-hw%2Fhw3%2Fhomework.py%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fmuskanp%2FDesktop%2FCSCI561-hw%2Fhw3%2Fhomework.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A25%2C%22character%22%3A54%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") column and aligns the training and testing datasets to have the same columns, filling missing values with zero.

This preprocessing ensures the data is clean and ready for model training and evaluation.
